# Free for dev mind map

Source project: https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev

Developers and Open Source authors now have many services offering free tiers, but finding them all takes time to make informed decisions.

This is a list of software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.) and other offerings with free developer tiers.

This project is to convert the list into a mind map for easier viewing in an outline format.
